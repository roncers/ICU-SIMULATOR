# TFG
This repository contains part of the research and programming work I carried out for my Bachelor’s thesis.
It is a simulation model of an ICU developed in R, and I truly enjoyed both the investigation and the coding process.
Through this project, I learned a new programming language (R) as well as a TeX-based markup language (LaTeX), since the thesis itself was written in LaTeX.
