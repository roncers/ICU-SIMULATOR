# TFG
This repo contains some of the investigation & programming I have done for my Bachelor's Thesis
It's a simulation model of an ICU made in R, I really loved investigating about it and coding it.
Also I did it with LaTeX so I learned 1 new programming language (R) and 1 new markup language based on TeX.
